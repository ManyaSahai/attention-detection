# Computer Vision System for Gauging Student Attentiveness in Online Classes
The education sector has been disrupted by online learning. However, a signif-
icant concern about students; real participation is raised in the process. Such
expertise could be very beneficial to improving teacher-student engagement and
subsequently, the overall quality of education in online classes. By detecting char-
acteristics like Facial Expressions, Head Pose Estimation, and Eye Tracking, a
Student Attentiveness Detection System will significantly help in obtaining such
insights, providing a means to evaluate whether students are paying attention dur-
ing lectures or not. The proposed method would be to analyze the video camera
feed of students during online lectures and detect the various parameters specified
before conclusively derive focus levels of students during specific lectures using sev-
eral models such as MTCNN (Multi-task Cascade Convolution Neural Network),
coupled with the OpenCV Framework to subsequently try and derive focus levels
of students as the desired insights for the output.
